⚠️ DEPRECATED - This script has been superseded by 06_precompute_derived_stats.py

This old script worked with the legacy dbt_rh_tidy.parquet single-file format.

The new workflow uses regional hourly files:
1. Run 05_build_epw_index_and_extract.py --regional
2. Run 06_precompute_derived_stats.py

See data_preparation_scripts/README.md for details.
